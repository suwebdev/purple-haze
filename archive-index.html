                        A free bird leaps <br>
                        on the back of the wind   <br>
                        and floats downstream   <br>
                        till the current ends <br>
                        and dips his wing <br>
                        in the orange sun rays <br>
                        and dares to claim the sky. <br>
                        <br>
                        But a bird that stalks <br>
                        down his narrow cage <br>
                        can seldom see through <br>
                        his bars of rage <br>
                        his wings are clipped and   <br>
                        his feet are tied <br>
                        so he opens his throat to sing. <br>
                        <br>
                        The caged bird sings   <br>
                        with a fearful trill   <br>
                        of things unknown   <br>
                        but longed for still   <br>
                        and his tune is heard   <br>
                        on the distant hill   <br>
                        for the caged bird   <br>
                        sings of freedom. <br>
                        <br>
                        The free bird thinks of another breeze <br>
                        and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees <br>
                        and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn <br>
                        and he names the sky his own <br>
                        <br>
                        But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   <br>
                        his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   <br>
                        his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   <br>
                        so he opens his throat to sing. <br>
                        <br>
                        The caged bird sings   <br>
                        with a fearful trill   <br>
                        of things unknown   <br>
                        but longed for still   <br>
                        and his tune is heard   <br>

                        You, created only a little lower than <br>
                        The angels, have crouched too long in   <br>
                        The bruising darkness <br>
                        Have lain too long <br>
                        Facedown in ignorance, <br>
                        Your mouths spilling words <br>
                        Armed for slaughter. <br>

                        That I dance like I’ve got diamonds<br>
                        At the meeting of my thighs?<br>
                        <br>
                        Out of the huts of history’s shame<br>
                        I rise<br>
                        Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br>
                        I rise<br>
                        I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br>
                        Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br>
                        <br>
                        Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br>
                        I rise<br>
                        Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br>
                        I rise<br>
                        Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br>
                        I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br>
                        I rise<br>
                        I rise<br>
                        I rise.<br>

                        I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size   <br>
                        But when I start to tell them, <br>
                        They think I’m telling lies. <br>
                        I say, <br>
                        It’s in the reach of my arms, <br>
                        The span of my hips,   <br>
                        The stride of my step,   <br>
                        The curl of my lips.   <br>
                        I’m a woman <br>
                        Phenomenally. <br>
                        Phenomenal woman,   <br>
                        That’s me. <br>
                        <br>
                        I walk into a room <br>
                        Just as cool as you please,   <br>
                        And to a man, <br>
                        The fellows stand or <br>
                        Fall down on their knees.   <br>
                        Then they swarm around me, <br>
                        A hive of honey bees.   <br>
                        I say, <br>
                        It’s the fire in my eyes,   <br>
                        And the flash of my teeth,   <br>
                        The swing in my waist,   <br>
                        And the joy in my feet.   <br>
                        I’m a woman <br>
                        Phenomenally. <br>
                        <br>
                        Phenomenal woman, <br>
                        That’s me. <br>
                        <br>
                        Men themselves have wondered   <br>
                        What they see in me. <br>
                        They try so much <br>
                        But they can’t touch <br>
                        My inner mystery. <br>
                        When I try to show them,   <br>
                        They say they still can’t see.   <br>
                        I say, <br>
                        It’s in the arch of my back,   <br>
                        The sun of my smile, <br>
                        The ride of my breasts, <br>
                        The grace of my style. <br>
                        I’m a woman <br>
                        Phenomenally. <br>
                        Phenomenal woman, <br>
                        That’s me. <br>
                        <br>
                        Now you understand <br>
                        Just why my head’s not bowed.   <br>
                        I don’t shout or jump about <br>
                        Or have to talk real loud.   <br>
                        When you see me passing, <br>
                        It ought to make you proud. <br>
                        I say, <br>
                        It’s in the click of my heels,   <br>
                        The bend of my hair,   <br>
                        the palm of my hand,   <br>
                        The need for my care.   <br>
                        ’Cause I’m a woman <br>
                        Phenomenally. <br>
                        Phenomenal woman, <br>
                        That’s me.<br>

                        And did I say Tender? <br>
                        The gentleness <br>
                        A big cat stalks through stubborn bush <br>
                        And did I mention Amber? <br>
                        The heatless fire consuming itself. <br>
                        Again. Anew. Into ever neverlessness. <br>
                        My man is Amber <br>
                        Changing <br>
                        Always into itself <br>
                        New. Now New <br>
                        Still itself. <br>

                        I almost laugh myself to death, <br>
                        My life has been one great big joke, <br>
                        A dance that’s walked <br>
                        A song that’s spoke, <br>
                        I laugh so hard I almost choke <br>
                        When I think about myself.<br>
                        <br>
                        Sixty years in these folks’ world <br>
                        The child I works for calls me girl <br>
                        I say “Yes ma’am” for working’s sake. <br>
                        Too proud to bend <br>
                        Too poor to break, <br>
                        I laugh until my stomach ache, <br>
                        When I think about myself.<br>
                        <br>
                        My folks can make me split my side, <br>
                        I laughed so hard I nearly died, <br>
                        The tales they tell, sound just like lying, <br>
                        They grow the fruit, <br>
                        But eat the rind, <br>
                        I laugh until I start to crying, <br>

                        and laugh and moan in Guinea,<br>
